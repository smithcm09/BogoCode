# BogoCode
This repository contains code related to my USGS-NSF GSP summer internship at CVO. 
I am looking at the development of tracking the bulk trajectory of volcanic lightning flashes at Bogoslof Volcano, AK
I am relating these trajectories to plume development and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis wind models.
